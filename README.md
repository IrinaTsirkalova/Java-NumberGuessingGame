# Number Guessing Game

**Description:**
The project is a number-guessing game. For the backend, I am using Maven application with java. And for the frondend - ReactJS.

There are two levels of difficulty: easy and hard.

In both levels, in the right corner in yellow are displayed hints. If the number the player has submitted is lower than the masked one, he will receive a message stating that fact.

In both levels, the player has five tries to guess the number. 

When the player wins or loses, he will receive a pop-up message.
